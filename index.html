                    <h2>Book Overview</h2>
                    <p>This book provides a structured and comprehensive introduction to the 
fundamental concepts, techniques, and applications of data mining.
introduces the basic data mining tasks, distinguishes data mining from 
knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and discusses key issues, metrics, 
social implications, and database perspectives. This foundation helps learners 
understand the scope and relevance of data mining in real-world scenarios. focuses on core data mining techniques, covering statistical perspectives, 
similarity measures, decision trees, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. 
These techniques form the backbone of modern data mining systems and are 
essential for practical implementation. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Data mining has emerged as an essential discipline in the modern 
data-driven world, enabling the extraction of meaningful knowledge from large 
and complex datasets.</li>
                            <li>data mining tasks, issues, and metrics, followed by 
detailed discussions on statistical methods, similarity measures, decision trees, 
neural networks, genetic algorithms, classification, clustering, and association 
rule mining. </li>
                            <li>Knowledge Discovery in Databases, or KDD, is a more encompassing 
process that includes data cleaning, integration, selection, transformation, 
mining, and interpretation.  </li>
                            <li>The broad characteristics of the data in the database are handled by the 
descriptive function</li>
                        </ul>
